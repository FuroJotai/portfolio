  text: `Hello, my name is Valera.
I’m a frontend developer specializing in modern websites, web applications, and adaptive design.
I turn ideas into elegant, responsive experiences that work seamlessly on any device—desktop or mobile—and, when needed, I bring them to life with subtle motion.

For me, building clean and visually engaging interfaces has become more than just work—it’s a passion, much like my other lifelong pursuit: dance and teaching.
That background taught me rhythm, precision, and flow, which I now apply to design and code.
I pay close attention to detail, always striving to polish every pixel and interaction until it feels right.

My goal is to merge your vision with my expertise, creating websites that are not only functional but also memorable and inspiring.
Every project I take on is a chance to blend creativity with craftsmanship—delivering results that reflect both your needs and my dedication.`,
