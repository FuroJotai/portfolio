  text: `Hi, I’m Valerii — a frontend developer focused on building clean, modern, and adaptive websites.
With a professional career as a dancer and teacher, I learned rhythm, precision, and attention to detail—skills I now apply to design and code.
Beyond the technical side, I value clear communication and a structured workflow: understanding your needs first, then translating them into intuitive interfaces.
I see every project as more than a website — it’s a digital stage where design, motion, and function come together to create an experience.
My goal is to turn ideas into crafted digital experiences that are functional, responsive, and memorable. Let’s build something remarkable together.`,
